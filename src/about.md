Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. I spend most of my time making them. This site is a simple archive of all my tweets. I have an obsession with archiving every digital content I own or find interesting. The web is not as permanent as we think. So this site serves as an alternative to my Twitter feed. Whatever happens to my account or content over on Twitter has no effect on this page. Any new tweets automatically show up here shortly after.
